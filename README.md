# Tennis match prediction

This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of tennis matches using Machine Learning techniques, specifically neural networks and decision trees. We trained and evaluated various models on historical tennis match data, including player statistics, head-to-head records, and tournament details. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model training, and optimization to improve predictive accuracy. By comparing the performance of different neural network architectures and decision tree models, we identified the most effective approaches for forecasting match results. The final models provide insights into potential applications in sports analytics and betting.
